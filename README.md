# TwinPrimes
New Twin Primes Algorithm 

. In this algorithm I am going to use a reverse way I am going to use the twin primes to get the primes and not the opposite.

I found that the primes that are not part of any twin primes like number 23, are factors for other composite primes and not part of any other twin prime pairs. 

They are part of pairs with perfect square numbers like These set of odd numbers of pairs [23,25] and like [47,49] and [119,121]. 
23, 47 ,119 are not in any twin pair but they are used as a factor in other odd pairs. 

These prime numbers are used as bind prime numbers and odd numbers that are not primes.
